  <h1>The Divisions of Ultimate</h1>
  <h2>Open (Men's)</h2>
  <p>Open was the first division of ultimate. Before there were enough players or interest to play Men-only, Women-only, or Mixed, anybody could play on any team. It is known as Open because a team is allowed to play Women if they so choose. Their opponent does not have to match the number of Women, or play any Women, or even carry any on their roster. Hence the name "Open" rather than "Men's" --  it is Open-gender. Traditionally it is Men only.</p>
  <h2>Women's</h2>
  <p>Women's Ultimate follows the exact same rules as Open, with the same size field, and disc. The only difference is that no team is allowed to play with any Men on the field. It is Women only. Men are allowed to be coaches or team staff (trainers, statisticians, etc) but not players.</p>
  <h2>Mixed</h2>
  <p>Mixed Ultimate is played with both Men and Women on the field at the same time. A team must have at least 3 Women on the field at all times. The team that receives the disc determines whether the point will be played with 4 Men and 3 Women (called "4-3"), or 3 Men and 4 Women ("3-4"). This rule is known as "Offense Dictates."</p>
